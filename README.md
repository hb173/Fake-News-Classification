# Fake-News-Classification

# Introduction
The practice of classifying or labeling documents with categories based on their content is known as document classification. Document classification is critical for properly managing large volumes of unstructured text data in a variety of applications. Because we live in a digital age, the quantity of information available is endless, whether we are talking about a person or an organization. Document classification is a valuable tool that may decrease the cost and time spent searching for the relevant information within text and filtering it out to make decision.

# Motivation
In our case, we chose Fake News detection as our NLP task as it has been all over the world for a few years now. Millions of people can quickly access social media and a news can quickly capture the attention of consumers. Major news companies have stated that not all the information supplied on social media is accurate, so we reasoned that by employing document classification, we would be able to handle the issue of whether a certain news is real or fake based on the frequency and placement of words.

# Data
The data set chosen for this analysis was taken from Kaggle and contained information on various news articles and can be found here. It contained information on the text of news article, the title of the article, author and a binary label indicating whether the article was reliable (0) or unreliable (1).
